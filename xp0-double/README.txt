This deploys a XP deployment with a CM and CD (but no reporting or processing instance like XP-full uses)

For this template to work, you need an XP0 CM web deploy package, and an XP1 CD web deploy package for the two web apps. In other words you need aspects of both the XP0 and XP1 packages Sitecore provides.

(or you can make your own templates with the Azure Toolkit)
